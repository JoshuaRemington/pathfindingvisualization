The Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. This tool provides a visual representation of how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and others find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It is a great educational tool for learning and understanding different pathfinding techniques.
