The Pathfinding Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. This tool provides a visual representation of how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and others find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It is a great educational tool for learning and understanding different pathfinding techniques.

### Features
Interactive grid for customizing start and end points as well as obstacles
Various pathfinding algorithms to choose from
Real-time visualization of algorithm progress
Adjustable animation speed for clearer observation
Clear grid and reset functionality
Easy-to-use and intuitive user interface

### Algorithms
The Pathfinding Visualizer currently supports the following algorithms:

Dijkstra's Algorithm

A* Search

Greedy Best-first Search

Breadth-first Search (BFS)

Depth-first Search (DFS)
